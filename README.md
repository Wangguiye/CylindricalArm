# CylindricalArm
An academic project of creating a robot arm simulator. My robot is a circular arm robot. The simulation enables the user to move each
robot part independently. We can test the robots behaviour by putting an element in desired coordinates and commanding the robot 
to pick it up and put it on the lift. The user may also view the robot from any desired position using mouse to rotate the view 
and keys w,a,s,d to move the camera in different directions. Click start and test the robot!</br>
Here are some images of the users view:
